# Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is used, which contains measurements for sepals and petals of three different species of iris flowers. The model predicts the species based on these features.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Training a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluating model accuracy

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script to train the model and make predictions.
